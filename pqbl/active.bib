  abstract = {The printing press long ago and the computer today have made 
              widespread access to information possible. Learning theorists 
              have suggested, however, that mere information is a poor way to 
              learn. Instead, more effective learning comes through doing. 
              While the most popularized element of today's MOOCs are the video 
              lectures, many MOOCs also include interactive activities that can 
              afford learning by doing. This paper explores the learning 
              benefits of the use of informational assets (e.g., videos and 
              text) in MOOCs, versus the learning by doing opportunities that 
              interactive activities provide. We find that students doing more 
              activities learn more than students watching more videos or 
              reading more pages. We estimate the learning benefit from extra 
              doing (1 SD increase) to be more than six times that of extra 
              watching or reading. Our data, from a psychology MOOC, is 
              correlational in character, however we employ causal inference 
              mechanisms to lend support for the claim that the associations we 
              find are causal.},

  abstract = {We compared students’ self-reported perception of learning with 
              their actual learning under controlled conditions in 
              large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught 
              using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the 
              discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced 
              and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical 
              class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and 
              the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit 
              of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as 
              would be expected based on prior research), but their perception 
              of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers 
              in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate 
              instruction based on students’ perceptions of learning could 
              inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods. For 
              instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive 
              feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures 
              over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest 
              that when students experience the increased cognitive effort 
              associated with active learning, they initially take that effort 
              to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a 
              detrimental effect on students’ motivation, engagement, and 
              ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students 
              can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively 
              engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be 
              impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss 
              strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to 
              improve students’ response to being actively engaged in the 
              classroom.}}

  abstract = {Abstract This study compares the impact of an active teaching 
              approach and a traditional (or passive) teaching style on student 
              cognitive outcomes. Across two sections of an introductory 
              business course, one class was taught in an active or 
              “nontraditional” manner, with a variety of active learning 
              exercises. The second class was taught in a passive or 
              “traditional” manner, emphasizing daily lectures. Although the 
              active learning approach does not appear to have improved overall 
              mastery of the subject, we did find evidence that active learning 
              can lead to improved cognitive outcomes in class-specific 
              materials. The discussion emphasizes the role of delivery style 
              on learning outcomes.},
